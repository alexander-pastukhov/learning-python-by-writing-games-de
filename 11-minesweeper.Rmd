## Minesweeper
Today we are going to program a simplified text-based version of the minesweeper game. In this game, you need to clear up a rectangular patch while not hitting a mine. Every time you open a cell, you either get blown up, if there was a mine, or you are shown a number of mines in the surrounding cells. The game is over once you opened all fields which are not mines. The classic game uses graphics and mouse but we will replicate it using text only. Therefore, instead of clicking on a cell, the player will need to enter its coordinates using row (letter) and column (digit). Below is an example of how a 5×5 game field would look like in the output with all fields still unopened.

```{python echo=FALSE}
import numpy as np

FIELD_SIZE = 5
MINES_N = 5

def print_minefield(minefied):
  """Print minefield.
  
  Parameters
  ----------
  minefield : np.array
  """
  columns = '  ' + ''.join(np.arange(1, minefied.shape[0] + 1).astype(str))
  
  
  print(columns)
  print("  " + "".join(["-"] * (minefied.shape[0])))
  for irow in range(minefied.shape[0]):
    print(chr(ord("A") + irow) + "|", end="")
    for cell in field[irow, ]:
      if cell in ["*", " "]:
        print("•", end="")
      else:
        print(cell, end="")
    print()  


# create an empty field
field = np.full((FIELD_SIZE, FIELD_SIZE), ' ')

np.random.seed(42)

# place mines
for _ in range(MINES_N):
  # finding a vacant spot
  xy = np.random.randint(0, FIELD_SIZE, 2)
  while field[xy[0], xy[1]] == "*":
    xy = np.random.randint(0, FIELD_SIZE, 2)
  field[xy[0], xy[1]] = "*"

# print out an empty one
print_minefield(field)
``` 

And this how it should look like once all cells but the mines are open.

```{python echo=FALSE}
def count_mines(minefield, xy):
  """Count mines in surrounding cells.
  
  Parameters
  ----------
  minefield : np.array
  xy : tuple
  
  Returns
  ----------
  int
  """
  # figuring out slice limits given the edge problem
  left = max(xy[1] - 1, 0)
  right = min(xy[1] + 2, minefield.shape[1])
  top = max(xy[0] - 1, 0)
  bottom = min(xy[0] + 2, minefield.shape[0])
  
  return np.sum(minefield[top:bottom, left:right] == "*")
  
for ix in range(FIELD_SIZE):
  for iy in range(FIELD_SIZE):
    if field[ix, iy] != "*":
      field[ix, iy] = count_mines(field, (ix, iy))
      
print_minefield(field)
```

As per usual, we will build the game step by step.
 
## Printing column indexes via for loop{#print-end}
To visually help the player to identify columns, we need to print out their indexes, as in the output above. You _could_ define a string `"  12345"` by hand and print it out but we want to be more flexible and generate this string based on the size of the playing field stored in a constant `FIELD_SIZE`. The are multiple way to achieve the same end and we will implement them all (because this is all about practice and putting your skills to the test, remember?)

Our first approach is conceptually the simplest: Just loop over the range of numbers up to `FIELD_SIZE` and print them out one by one. Do remember that [range](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#range) goes from `0` to `stop - 1`, so think how you will adjust this for the output or which `start` and `stop` parameters you should use. The only problem we have is  every number will be printed in its own line. However, this is easy to fix via `end` parameter of the [print](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) function. By default, it is equal to `'\n'` (new line) but you can redefine it to any other string, including an empty one `''`. Use a for loop to print one digit at a time in the same line. Do not forget to prepend it with two extra spaces to account for later row indexing. 

::: {.program}
Implement code in Exercise 1.
:::

## Joining all column indexes into a single string{#str.join}
Another way to achieve the same end is to:

1. Create a list of numbers.
2. Convert each element of a list to a string via [list comprehensions](#list-comprehension)
3. [join](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join) them into a string.

The first step is easy: you use the same [range](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#range) to create the sequence of numbers. The second one is also easy (at least you have done it before!): use list comprehension to loop over values produced by range and convert them to a [string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str) one by one. Do not forget to adjust numbers, as you did in the previous version, before converting them to strings. The final part is new but conceptually very simple. [join](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join) is a _method_ of a string that joins a list of strings (and only strings, this is why we needed list comprehension for conversion) using an "original" string as a separator. Here are couple of examples of how it works:

```{python}
a_list = ["cat", "dog", "duck"]
print(' - '.join(a_list))
print(''.join(a_list))
```
Implement this solution for our column index. Do not forget to prepend it with two extra spaces. Instead of using an extra print as before, join the two strings via `+`. E.g., 

```{python}
print('a cat and' + ' a dog')
```
```{python echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
numbers_as_strings = [str(number + 1) for number in  range(FIELD_SIZE)]
'  ' + ''.join(numbers_as_strings)
```


::: {.program}
Implement code in Exercise 2.
:::

## Joining a numpy array of strings into a single string
You already know about [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and, of course, it has a solution for problems like this as well. Here, we will

1. Build an array of ordered numbers using [arange](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.arange.html).
2. Convert them all to an array via [astype](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.astype.html) method.
3. [Join](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join) values just as you did before.

Again, first one is easy, as you already used [arange](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.arange.html), just think about `start` and `stop` values to get the `1`..`FIELD_SIZE` array you need. Now the second one is new but is conceptually simple. You can change type of all elements of the array by calling its [astype](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.astype.html) method and specifying a new type. For example, here is how you convert an array of integers into an array of logical values (remember, `0` is `False`, everything else is `True`):

```{python}
an_array_of_integers = np.array([0, 1, 0, 2, 3, 0])
an_array_of_integers.astype(bool)
```
You need to use the same code but for the type you need: `str`. The last step ---- joining individual elements into a single string and prepanding it with two extra spaces --- is exactly the same as in the previous solution.

::: {.program}
Implement code in Exercise 3.
:::

## Drawing a horizontal line
The next part of the output is a horizontal line `FIELD_SIZE` long (plus two extra spaces in front!) That should be easy, just use [list repetition](#list-repetition) to build a `FIELD_SIZE` long list of `-` elements and join them the same way you did for digits.

::: {.program}
Implement code in Exercise 4.
:::

## Converting character to code and back {#chr-ord}
The rows are marked with characters, so we need a simple way of translating between letters and numbers. The simplest approach here is to convert characters to their code via [ord](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord) function and from the code back to a character via [chr](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#chr) function. Here is how it works:

```{python}
# code from symbol
a_symbol = 'G'
print(ord(a_symbol))


# symbol from code
a_code = 72
print(chr(a_code))
```

Build a list of characters starting from `"A"` which is `FIELD_SIZE` letters long. Remember that codes for letters are consecutive, so code for `"B"` is larger than code for `"A"` by one, the code for `"C"` is larger than code for `"A"` by two, etc. In the exercise, simply print out this letters one-by-one in each separate line using a for loop.

::: {.program}
Implement code in Exercise 5.
:::

## Inputing coordinates
We now have a coordinate system, so let us create an input function (`input_coords`) that will prompt user to enter the coordinates of the next cell that they want to open until they give a _valid_ input. For example, for a 5×5 playing field `A3` or `e5` should be valid inputs, but `f1`, `a6`, or `huh` will in invalid. The function should accept `field_size` as a parameter and return a list of two _numbers_, i.e., it should convert both column (originally digit) and row (originally letter) to a corresponding zero-based row and column index. So, `A3` would become `(0, 2)` and `e5` would be `(4, 4)`.

You already have experience of writing functions that annoy the user until they give valid input, so this should be fairly straightforward. The main difference is that there are multiple things to check this time:

1. String has [length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len) of $2$ (one symbol for row, one for column)
2. First character of the string is a letter within valid range
3. Second character of the string is a digit within a valid range.

Here is the information you need to complete this. You can access individual characters of the string the same way you do it with lists:

```{python}
a_string = "cat"
a_string[2]
```

To check whether a letter is a valid range, you need to 1) build a list of valid letters and 2) check that the first symbol is [in](#in-collection) this list. In the previous exercise, you printed these valid letters one by one, so here you need to put them all into a list via [list comprehensions](#list-comprehension) instead. You list will be either upper or lower case, so make sure that you enforce the case for the symbol via [upper](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=upper#str.upper) or [lower](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=upper#str.lower) case. 

::: {.program}
Do Exercise 6.
:::

To check whether the second symbol is a digit within a correct range, you can either do the same trick of 1) building a list of _strings_ with valid digits, and 2) checking whether the second symbol is in it. But instead, use the [isdigit](#isdigit) method in combination with [int](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int), as you did when [Hunting the Wumpus](#hunt-the-wumpus).

::: {.program}
Do Exercise 7.
:::

Now that you know how to perform all the checks, you can write the `input_coords` function. As before, prompt the player in a [while loop](#while-loop) until it pass all three checks. Then convert each symbol to an index. The second symbol is easy, as you already converted it to an integer, just correct it for zero-based indexing ($1$ should be $0$, $2$ should be $1$, etc.). The first one, is a touch trickier but you already know how to convert a character to a number via [ord](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord) and the only thing to remember is that `"A"` is $0$ (think how this is useful).

## Creating an empty minefield via NumPy {#np.fill}
Our mine field will be a 2D [NumPy array](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html), same as for our [Sudoku](#sudoku-brute-force) puzzle. The only difference is that instead of numbers, we will use characters (strings) indicate the content of the cell. A cell with a mine in it, will be `"*"`. A cell _without_ a mine, initially will be `" "` (space symbol) but once the player opens it this will be replaced with the number of mines around it (for example, `"1"` or `"0'`). We will worry about turning empty space into numbers later, as our first job is to generate a minefield itself.

You start with an empty field `FIELD_SIZE` × `FIELD_SIZE`, so a NumPy array of `" "` with size `(FIELD_SIZE, FIELD_SIZE)`. As per usual, there are multiple ways of creating it. First, create a list of list via [list repetition](#list-repetition) and then convert it into a [NumPy array](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html). Recall that you can generate a list of characters by putting a single character into a list and then repeating this list `FIELD_SIZE` times. And then, you can repeat _that_ list `FIELD_SIZE` again. 

::: {.program}
Implement this in  Exercise 8.
:::

Alternatively, you can make your life easier by generating an array [full](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.full.html) of this symbol.

::: {.program}
Implement this in  Exercise 9.
:::

## Putting in mines
Now that you have an empty field, you should put some mines into it! Define a constant `MINES_NUMBER` and set it to a reasonable number of mines (remember, the more you have, the harder the game is). Next, put in `MINES_NUMBER` of mines at random places. For this (=you probably need [for](#for-loop) and / or [while](#while-loop):

1. generate a pair of valid row and column indexes
2. check that that cell is empty (no mine in it)
3. place the mine if cell is empty, go to step 1 otherwise

Combined your code with that our exercise 9 to generate a minefield

::: {.program}
Implement code in  Exercise 10.
:::

## Printing out the minefield
You have the minefield and you know how to print out the row and column index. Combine them all into a function `print_minefield` that takes the minefield array as the only input and prints out `"•"` if the field is empty but unopened (`" "`) or has a mine in it (`"*"`, remember, if player opened the mine, the game is over). The only other option is an already opened cell and that will contain a digit with number of surrounding mines (coming up shortly!). You definitely need nested [for-loops](#for-loop) and conditional statements. Recall that the output should look like this (all fields are either empty or have unopened mines):

```{python echo=FALSE}
FIELD_SIZE = 5
MINES_N = 1

field = np.full((FIELD_SIZE, FIELD_SIZE), '•')

columns = '  ' + ''.join(np.arange(1, FIELD_SIZE + 1).astype(str))


print(columns)
print("  " + "".join(["-"] * (FIELD_SIZE)))
for irow in range(FIELD_SIZE):
  print(chr(ord("A") + irow) + "|", end="")
  for cell in field[irow, ]:
    if cell == "*":
      print(" ", end="")
    else:
      print(cell, end="")
  print()
```

:::

## Counting surrounding mines
We are almost done, as we have a field full of mines, we can print it, and we can ask player for which field to open. However, once the player opens the field and it is not a mine, we need to count the number of mines in the surrounding cells. This can range from `$0$` (no mines at all) to `$8$` (you landed in a cell completely surrounded by mines). 

![Example of mine counts for different cells](images/minesweeper-mine-counts.svg){width=100% style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}<br/>


The implementation of this is fairly straightforward (although there is a catch):

1. Extract a 3×3 matrix that surround the cell
2. Compute a logical array of whether these cells are equal to `"*"`
3. Compute the total number of mines via [numpy.sum](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html#numpy.sum)

Remember that I warned you about the catch? Well, if our cell is on the _edge_ of the field, we cannot have a 3×3 cut-out:

![Example of edge cells](images/minesweeper-edge-problem.svg){width=100% style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"} <br/>

There are two ways to solve the problem. First, you can pad the array with `" "` symbols and work with a `(FIELD_SIZE + 2, FIELD_SIZE + 2)` array. In this case, you don't have to worry about edge cases, as they always have cells near them. And you don't need convert indexes to zero-based as your actual minefield now goes from `1` to `FIELD_SIZE` and not from `0` to `FIELD_SIZE - 1` as for zero-based index. However, for didactic reasons, we will instead implement a more complicated solution that automatically adjust the limits of the cut-out area.

You already cut-out rectangular part of a numpy array when you looked at validity of [Sudoku blocks](##sudoku-block). Here the logic is the same, as you need to compute 1) starting row, 2) ending row, 3) starting column, 4) ending column. However, before using these numbers you need to that both starting row and columns are no lower than $0$ and ending row and columns are no higher than `FIELD_SIZE`. You can use conditional if-else statements, but let us use this as an opportunity to create limit checks via [min](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#min) and [max](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max) functions. Here is the logic, a cell's column index (the one you counting mines for) can for from $0$ to $4$, which means that the index for the cells to its left go from $-1$ to $3$. The lowest valid column index is $0$, so think how you can pick a correct number out of 1) index of the cell to the left, 2) lowest possible index of $0$ using either [min](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#min) and [max](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max) (which one do you need for this?)

::: {.program}
Implement code in  Exercise 11.
:::

The logic is similar for the right edge but, because slicing excludes the stop value, the right edge of our rectangular slice is `column + 2` (so goes from $2$ till $6$) rather than `column + 1`. However, the largest valid index is `FIELD_SIZE`. Again, use either [min](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#min) and [max](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max) to pick the correct limit.

::: {.program}
Implement code in  Exercise 12.
:::

The logic for row limits is the same. Once you have the rectangular limits, compare all the elements to `"*"` (mine). Remember, this is a vectorized NumPy array, so you can just compare the entire array to `"*"` and NumPy will do it elementwise for you. Then, just count the number of mines via [numpy.sum](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html#numpy.sum).

Write a function `count_mines` that takes the matrix and coordinates as two parameters and returns the number of mines as the output. Note that you do not need to pass the `FIELD_SIZE` constant explicitly, as you can compute it from the [shape](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.shape.html) of the minefield itself. As per usual, document it (same went for all function above as well!)! Here is an example array you can test it on:
```{python eval=FALSE}
a_minefield = np.array(
  [[' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
   [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
   [' ', ' ', '*', ' ', '*'],
   [' ', ' ', '*', ' ', '*'],
   [' ', '*', ' ', ' ', ' ']], dtype='<U1')
```

::: {.program}
Implement `count_mines` in _utils.py_ <br/>
Test it in _code03.py_ using hard coded minefield <br/>
and coordinates.
:::

## Putting it all together
Now you do have everything you need! Write a program that generates a mine field and then asks the player for coordinates. If the player entered coordinates of the mine, the game is over. Otherwise, the number of mines around it computed and _put into that cell_. Next, the updated minefield is printed out and the player is asked for coordinates again. 

The game is over once the player hits the main _or_ once the player open up all the empty fields. In the latter case, all empty fields will be converted from `" "` to a number, so no `" "` symbols will be left in the array. In other words, if you count the number of `" "` in the minefield matrix and it is zero, the player won! Here, think about your while loop variable. You can use the logical one but you can also implement a `game_state` variable that is initially set to `"playing"` and the game continuous for as long as the `game_state` is `"playing"`. If the player exploded, it will be changed to `"exploded"` and once the player opened all the fields it should change to `"victory"`. Then, _after_ the game loop, check the `game_state` and print and appropriate (happy or sad) message.


Test the code using a smaller 2×2 field with one or two mines. You can (sneakily) print out the raw minefield matrix to help yourself win and test all scenarios.

::: {.program}

:::

## Spreading through the empty space
Our game is feature complete but it is laborious, as we need to put in coordinates of every single cell that (we think) does not contain a mine. However, the original game has a cool feature of opening "trivial" cases for the player. When the cell you open has _no_ mines around it, the empty fields automatically spread to the limits of non-zero counts. Here is an example for the same minefield I used before and the player decide to open the top left corner. As this is part of the empty field, computer opens all of its neighbors and does the same for every zero-count neighbor until it runs out of cells to open. If calling a function to open fields for a neighbor from inside the function that opens fields for the cell sounds like a recursion, this is because it is! 

![Example of spreading](images/minesweeper-spread.svg){width=100% style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"} <br/>

The algorithm itself is very straightforward but we will start by creating a modified version of our `count_mines` function first. Instead of returning the number of mines to the main script, it will put this number directly into the cell. In other words, it will modify [mutable](#mutable-objects) matrix in place without returning anything (so we don't need the assignment in the main code as well).

Call function `count_mines_and_fill` and let it call `count_mines` for the main job. Same inputs, _no_ output, _no_ assignment in the main script. Otherwise, the code is the same and should work the same way. Note that we _could_ simply call the original `count_mines` from the new function and, for a moment, it would work just fine. But `count_mines_and_fill` is just a precursor for the `count_mines_and_spread` that needs to know the coordinates of rectangular slice, so we need the internal computation performed by `count_mines` and need to reuse this code. 


::: {.program}
Implement `count_mines_and_fill` in _utils.py_ <br/>
Code game in _code05.py_
:::

Now to the recursion. The function `count_mines_and_spread` inherits the code of `count_mines_and_fill` and extends it for the case when mines count is zero. Then, the function should loop (nested loops?) over all neighboring cells and call itself on them, forcing to count the mines, put the counts in and, potentially, spread it even further if the neighboring counts turn out to be zeros as well.

![Example of spreading (again)](images/minesweeper-spread.svg){width=100% style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"} <br/>

Note that the function could be called for the _same_ cell multiple times and that might be a problem. Look at the illustration above. We start at the top-left cell `(0, 0)`. Because its mine count is zero, we call the same function on all its neighbors. But for `(1, 0)` mine count is also zero, which means it calls the function for all of _its_ neighbors including, of course, `(0, 0)`! Since mine counts for `(0, 0)` are zero, it triggers another call to `(1, 0)`, which calls it on `(0, 0)` ad infinitum. To prevent this, we only need to check whether we already proceed this cell _before_ we do anything else. In other words, the first thing you need to do is to check whether cell's  value is equal to `" "` (we did not process it yet). If this is not the case (we already counted mines for it), the function should just return (literally, just `return` with no output, as out function returns no output).

And these are the only extra bits: 1) check if cell was already processed at the beginning, 2) calling itself on all the neighbors, if cell's mine count is zero. Either use a hard coded minefield we defined above for testing, or use a largish (5×5) field with just one mine, to see the spread. Do you need to modify anything in the main script beyond the function name?
